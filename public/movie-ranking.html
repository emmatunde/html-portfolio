        <h4>Movie Summary</h4>
        <p>
          Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti (born October 25, 1900, Abeokuta, Egbaland [now

        <h4>My Review</h4>
        <p>
          This movie is a 8/10 rating for me. I am not only intrigued by the
          perfect role play by the actor but the story line itself.<br />
          Olufumnilayo is a very brake and couragous woman whom against all odd
          forth for the freedom of other women during <br />her time. The
          society needs more people like her. selfless and brave.
